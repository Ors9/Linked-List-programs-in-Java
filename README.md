# Java LinkedList Examples

This repository contains Java classes representing implementations of linked lists.

## IntNode

The `IntNode` class represents a node in a singly linked list. It contains methods to get and set the value of the node, as well as to get and set the reference to the next node.

## IntList

The `IntList` class represents a singly linked list of integers. It provides methods to manipulate the list, such as adding elements to the end, converting the list to a string, and performing operations on sublists.

## IntNodeTwo

The `IntNodeTwo` class represents a node in a doubly linked list. Similar to `IntNode`, it contains methods to get and set the value of the node, as well as to get and set the references to the next and previous nodes.

## IntListTwo

The `IntListTwo` class represents a doubly linked list of integers. It provides methods to manipulate the list, such as adding elements to the end, converting the list to a string, and checking for a valid path within the list.

Each class includes detailed Javadoc comments explaining the purpose of the class and each of its methods.

Feel free to explore the code and use it in your projects!
